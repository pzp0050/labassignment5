Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study

Normally I store those documents in harddrives and some times I upload DNA 
sequence data in to repositories like NCBI gene bank. So storing important 
documents in physical drives is less protective than using Git like remote 
repositories because physical drives can damage and limited individual can 
use those in same time. So I think from this module I learned lot of things 
about git and hope to use these techniques and methods in my future research 
work.
In evolutionary biology we always work with DNA sequences and phylogenetic 
trees like thinks. So to make phylogenetic trees we use those DNA sequences 
and also some programming codes. now days many researches adding their 
sequences in to gene bank like repositories and codes in to git like 
repositories. This will help to other researches who are working on similar 
research works. So I think reproducibility is highly affected to the 
advancement of my research field
